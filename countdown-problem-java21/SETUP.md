# Countdown Problem

[CountDownProblem.java](CountDownProblem.java) is the complete example used in the article https://inside.java/2023/11/03/countdown-haskell-java.
The code represents the Java port of [a Haskell example](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pgp-countdown.hs) authored by Prof. Graham Hutton.
The problem and the solution approaches of the Haskell example are explained in https://youtu.be/CiXDS3bBBUo?list=PLF1Z-APd9zK7usPMx3LGMZEHrECUGodd3.

## Prerequisites

You need JDK 21+ installed on your machine to run this sample. 
Find out how to achieve that by going through the [setting up a JDK section](https://dev.java/learn/getting-started/#setting-up-jdk) of https://dev.java/.

## Run the progam

Make sure you are inside the _countdown-haskell-java_ directory and then run the following command in a terminal:

```shell
